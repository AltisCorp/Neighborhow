			<p>We&#39;re working on improving this form. We&#39;d <a href="<?php echo $app_url;?>/add-feedback" title="Give us feedback">love your feedback</a>!</p>
			<p><strong>Your Neighborhow Guide doesn&#39;t have to be "perfect."</strong> Neighborhow is about informal neighbor knowledge, so we&#39;d like it to sound like you, rather than your 10th grade English teacher.</p>
			<p>For now, Guides can have up to 15 steps. It&#39;s a good idea plan out your Guide content before you start entering it in the form.</p>
			<p>For each step, Title and Description are required. You can also add an optional photo to any step.</p>
			<p>To add another step, use the "Add Another Step" checkbox.</p>
			<p>Be sure to close any empty steps before you save your Guide.</p>
			<p>You don&#39;t have to finish your Guide all at once. Just click "Save Guide," and a draft will be stored on your Profile page. You can return at any time to complete it.</p>
